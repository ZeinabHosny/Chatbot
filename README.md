#### In this task:
 
 1. I uesd Tf-idf vectorizer and cosine simularity to build a question/answer chatbot from CoQa dataset 
 2. The chatbot prints only the top one answer if the simularity of its question is larger than 0.5
 3. If the simlrity of top one questions < .5 it prints the answes of the top five questions as suggestions
 4. I made the same chatbot but replaced the TF-IDF by LSTM model used also for vectorization of questions by taking the output of the encoder part
 5. The LSTM model i can't upload on Gitlab as its size is large; so i uploaded it on drive and here is the link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=10rx0gIZgpkr2mNQWUgrxj-s6i-XuKoc8
